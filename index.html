    <li><strong>Samvad - Bridging Voices, Connecting Lives</strong> - Samvad, meaning communication in Sanskrit, is a
      project designed to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. It offers
      real-time voice-to-text and text-to-voice translation, with a focus on supporting Indian regional languages such
      as Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and more. By enabling users to convert spoken words into text or text into speech
      instantly, Samvad empowers people to communicate effectively in various settings, including education, workplaces,
      and daily life. This inclusive solution promotes accessibility, independence, and linguistic diversity, making it
      an invaluable tool for breaking barriers and fostering meaningful interactions for those with communication
      challenges.
